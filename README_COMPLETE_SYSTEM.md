## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Method 1: Direct Python Usage

```python
from L_1.L1_learner import ConfigurableBootstrapper, PatternBasedChunker

# Create learner for broker entities
learner = ConfigurableBootstrapper('broker', config_dir='configs')

# Train on text data
text = "The client opened an account with ZERODHA for trading."
entities = {"ZERODHA": "ZERODHA"}
learner.learn_from_paragraph(text, entities)

# Create intelligent chunker
chunker = PatternBasedChunker([learner], max_chunk_size=200)

# Chunk text intelligently
document = "SBI SECURITIES managed the portfolio. ZERODHA provided services."
chunks = chunker.chunk_text(document)

print(f"Created {len(chunks)} intelligent chunks")
```

### Method 2: REST API

```bash
# Start the API server
python3 api_server.py

# Train patterns via API
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/train" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entity_type": "broker",
    "text": "ZERODHA offers discount brokerage services.",
    "entities": {"ZERODHA": "ZERODHA"}
  }'

# Chunk text via API
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/chunk" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "The portfolio was managed by SBI SECURITIES.",
    "entity_types": ["broker"],
    "max_chunk_size": 200
  }'
```

### Method 3: Python Client

```python
from api_client_example import PatternLearningClient

client = PatternLearningClient("http://127.0.0.1:8000")

# Train patterns
result = client.train_patterns(
    entity_type="broker",
    text="HDFC SECURITIES provides investment services.",
    entities={"HDFC SECURITIES": "HDFC SECURITIES"}
)

# Intelligent chunking
chunks = client.chunk_text(
    text="Long document with multiple broker names...",
    entity_types=["broker"],
    max_chunk_size=512
)
```
